# TODO Basket Implementation - Summary (Round 7)

## Overview

This PR implements a focused seventh basket of high-value features from the TODO list, emphasizing match realism, team management depth, and player performance tracking.

**Total Time:** ~2 hours
**Total Tests:** 161 (was 141, +20 new tests)
**Test Pass Rate:** 100%
**Breaking Changes:** None (fully backward compatible)

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Pitch Conditions (Match Realism)

**Feature:** Matches now include pitch condition tracking with 6 distinct states.

- **6 pitch types:** Excellent, Good, Average, Worn, Poor, Waterlogged
- **Deterministic generation:** Based on match ID hash (same match = same conditions)
- **Weather influence:** Rain/snow increase chance of poor/waterlogged conditions
- **Distribution (good weather):** 25% Excellent, 35% Good, 25% Average, 10% Worn, 4% Poor, 1% Waterlogged
- **Distribution (rainy):** Increased chance of Waterlogged/Poor conditions
- **Distribution (snowy):** Mostly Worn/Poor conditions
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/entities.py` - PitchCondition enum, Match.pitch_condition field

### 2. Team Captains & Vice-Captains (Team Management)

**Feature:** Each team now has designated captain and vice-captain with intelligent selection.

- **Captain selection:** Highest-rated experienced player (age 25+)
- **Position preference:** Midfielders (CM, CAM) and defenders (CB) preferred
- **Vice-captain:** Second-highest rated player from captain candidates
- **Deterministic:** Based on player ratings and attributes (reproducible)
- **Fallback logic:** If no experienced midfielders/defenders, selects from any experienced players
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/entities.py` - Team.captain_id, Team.vice_captain_id fields
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/data.py` - Captain assignment logic in create_fantasy_team()

### 3. Average Player Ratings (Performance Tracking)

**Feature:** Players now track match ratings and calculate rolling averages.

- **Match ratings list:** Stores all historical match ratings (1.0-10.0 scale)
- **Average calculation:** Property that computes mean of all ratings
- **Automatic update:** Ratings added after every match automatically
- **Use cases:** Player comparisons, form tracking, transfer valuations, awards
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/entities.py` - Player.match_ratings field, Player.average_rating property
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/simulation.py` - _update_player_ratings_history() method

### 4. Season Records Infrastructure (Competition Tracking)

**Feature:** Leagues now have infrastructure to track season-specific records.

- **Records structure:** Dict mapping season -> record data
- **Flexible schema:** Can store any type of record (goals, defense, clean sheets, etc.)
- **Example records:** Most goals in season, best defense, most assists, etc.
- **Foundation:** Enables future end-of-season award ceremonies
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/entities.py` - League.season_records field

### 5. Form Guide Enhancement (Already Implemented)

**Note:** Form guide (last 5 matches W/D/L) was already implemented in the codebase.

- **Tracking:** Team.recent_form list maintains last 5 results
- **Values:** "W" (win), "D" (draw), "L" (loss)
- **Automatic:** Updated after each match, maintains only last 5
- **Use cases:** Team momentum analysis, performance trends
- **Status:** Verified working, added comprehensive tests

## Technical Details

### Determinism

All new features maintain strict determinism:
- Pitch conditions use match ID hash as seed (same match = same conditions)
- Captain selection based on deterministic player attributes
- Player ratings generated by deterministic match simulation
- Same world seed = same captains, pitch conditions, and ratings

### Event Sourcing

Pitch conditions are part of Match entity:
- Set during fixture scheduling
- Stored in match state from creation
- No separate events needed (part of MatchScheduled context)

Captain assignments are part of Team entity:
- Set during team creation
- Stored in team state
- IDs reference players in team roster

### Performance

- No performance degradation
- Pitch condition generation: O(1) per match during scheduling
- Captain selection: O(n) where n = team size (runs once per team)
- Player ratings update: O(m) where m = players who participated (runs once per match)
- Season records: O(1) dict operations

### Backward Compatibility

All changes are additive and backward compatible:
- New fields have sensible defaults:
  - pitch_condition: PitchCondition.GOOD
  - captain_id: None
  - vice_captain_id: None
  - match_ratings: [] (empty list)
  - season_records: {} (empty dict)
- Old matches work with new system
- Old teams get None for captain fields until regenerated
- Old players get empty match_ratings list

## Usage Examples

### Pitch Conditions

```python
# Pitch conditions are automatically generated when matches are scheduled
match = world.matches["match_id"]
print(f"Pitch: {match.pitch_condition.value}")  # e.g., "Good"
print(f"Weather: {match.weather.value}")  # e.g., "Rainy"

# Weather affects pitch condition
if match.weather == Weather.RAINY:
    # Higher chance of Waterlogged/Poor conditions
    pass
```

### Team Captains

```python
team = world.teams["team_id"]
if team.captain_id:
    captain = world.get_player_by_id(team.captain_id)
    print(f"Captain: {captain.name}")
    print(f"Position: {captain.position.value}")
    print(f"Age: {captain.age}, Rating: {captain.overall_rating}")

if team.vice_captain_id:
    vice = world.get_player_by_id(team.vice_captain_id)
    print(f"Vice-Captain: {vice.name}")
```

### Average Player Ratings

```python
player = world.players["player_id"]

# Check historical ratings
print(f"Match ratings: {player.match_ratings}")  # e.g., [6.5, 7.0, 7.5]

# Get average
print(f"Average rating: {player.average_rating:.2f}")  # e.g., "7.00"

# Find top-rated players
top_players = sorted(
    [p for p in world.players.values() if len(p.match_ratings) > 0],
    key=lambda p: p.average_rating,
    reverse=True
)[:10]
```

### Season Records

```python
league = world.leagues["league_id"]

# Set season records (e.g., at end of season)
league.season_records[2025] = {
    "most_goals": {
        "player_id": "player_123",
        "player_name": "John Striker",
        "goals": 32,
        "team_id": "team_abc"
    },
    "best_defense": {
        "team_id": "team_xyz",
        "team_name": "Defensive Masters",
        "goals_conceded": 18
    },
    "most_assists": {
        "player_id": "player_456",
        "assists": 21
    }
}

# Retrieve records
top_scorer = league.season_records[2025]["most_goals"]
print(f"Top scorer: {top_scorer['player_name']} - {top_scorer['goals']} goals")
```

### Form Guide

```python
team = world.teams["team_id"]

# Check recent form (last 5 matches)
print(f"Form: {' '.join(team.recent_form)}")  # e.g., "W W D L W"

# Analyze form
wins = team.recent_form.count('W')
print(f"Won {wins} of last 5 matches")

# Form is updated automatically after each match
```
