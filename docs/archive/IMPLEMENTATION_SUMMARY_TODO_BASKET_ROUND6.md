# TODO Basket Implementation - Summary (Round 6)

## Overview

This PR implements a focused sixth basket of high-value features from the TODO list, emphasizing match atmosphere, player development tracking, and defensive statistics.

**Total Time:** ~2 hours
**Total Tests:** 141 (was 121, +20 new tests)
**Test Pass Rate:** 100%
**Breaking Changes:** None (fully backward compatible)

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Weather Conditions (Match Enhancement)

**Feature:** Matches now include weather conditions that affect attendance and atmosphere.

- **6 weather types:** Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, Windy, Foggy
- **Deterministic generation:** Weather is generated based on match ID hash
- **Distribution:** 30% Sunny, 25% Cloudy, 20% Rainy, 10% Windy, 10% Foggy, 5% Snowy
- **Impact:** Weather affects attendance (rain/snow reduce attendance by 15-30%)
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/entities.py` - Weather enum

### 2. Crowd Attendance & Atmosphere (Match Experience)

**Feature:** Matches now track attendance and stadium atmosphere ratings.

- **Attendance calculation:** Based on stadium capacity, team reputation, weather, and random variation
- **Base formula:** 75% of capacity × reputation modifier × weather modifier × random (±10%)
- **Bounds:** Minimum 1,000, maximum stadium capacity
- **Atmosphere rating:** 30-90 scale based on attendance ratio, boosted for big matches
- **Big match bonus:** +10 atmosphere when both teams have 60+ reputation
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/orchestrator.py` - Match creation logic

### 3. Player Potential Rating (Development System)

**Feature:** Players now have a potential rating indicating maximum achievable ability.

- **Age-based calculation:**
  - Young players (<23): Potential 10-25 points above current
  - Pre-peak (<peak age): Potential 5-15 points above current
  - Peak age (±2): Potential 0-5 points above current
  - Post-peak (>peak+2): Potential 0-2 points above current
- **Use cases:** Youth scouting, player development tracking, transfer decisions
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/data.py` - Player generation
- **Property:** Accessible via `player.potential`

### 4. Best/Worst Defense Statistics (API Endpoints)

**Feature:** Two new API endpoints for defensive statistics.

- **Endpoint 1:** `GET /api/leagues/{league_id}/best-defense`
  - Returns teams sorted by fewest goals conceded
  - Includes: goals_conceded, matches_played, average_per_game, clean_sheets
- **Endpoint 2:** `GET /api/leagues/{league_id}/worst-defense`
  - Returns teams sorted by most goals conceded
  - Same statistics as best-defense
- **Sorting:** Primary by goals conceded, secondary by clean sheets
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/server.py`

### 5. Detailed Injury History (Career Tracking)

**Feature:** Players now maintain a detailed injury history.

- **8 injury types tracked:**
  - Hamstring, Groin, Ankle, Knee, Shoulder, Concussion, Muscle, Broken Bone
- **Record fields:** injury_type, occurred_date, weeks_out, season, match_id
- **Storage:** List of InjuryRecord objects in player.injury_history
- **Use cases:** Injury-prone trait validation, medical staff decisions, player risk assessment
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/entities.py` - InjuryRecord, InjuryType

### 6. Player Awards Infrastructure (Recognition System)

**Feature:** Players can now receive and track career awards.

- **Award structure:** award_type, season, league, details
- **Examples:** "Player of the Season", "Golden Boot", "Best Defender", "Golden Glove"
- **Storage:** List of PlayerAward objects in player.awards
- **Foundation:** Enables future end-of-season award ceremonies
- **Location:** `src/neuralnet/entities.py` - PlayerAward

## Technical Details

### Determinism

All new features maintain strict determinism:
- Weather generation uses match ID hash as seed (same match ID = same weather)
- Attendance uses match-specific RNG with match ID seed
- Potential calculated deterministically from player name hash
- Same world seed = same weather, attendance, and potential ratings

### Event Sourcing

Weather and attendance are part of Match entity:
- Stored in match state from creation
- Accessible throughout match lifecycle
- No separate events needed (part of MatchScheduled context)

### Performance

- No performance degradation
- Weather/attendance calculated during fixture scheduling (O(1) per match)
- Potential calculated during player creation (O(1) per player)
- New API endpoints use existing O(n) team iteration
- Injury history and awards are simple list appends

### Backward Compatibility

All changes are additive and backward compatible:
- New fields have sensible defaults:
  - weather: Weather.CLOUDY (default)
  - attendance: 0 (default)
  - atmosphere_rating: 50 (default)
  - potential: 75 (default)
  - injury_history: [] (empty list)
  - awards: [] (empty list)
- Old matches work with new system
- Old players get default potential based on age

## Usage Examples

### Weather in Matches

```python
# Weather is automatically generated when matches are scheduled
match = world.matches["match_id"]
print(f"Weather: {match.weather.value}")  # e.g., "Rainy"
print(f"Attendance: {match.attendance:,}")  # e.g., "28,500"
print(f"Atmosphere: {match.atmosphere_rating}/100")  # e.g., "72/100"
```

### Player Potential

```python
player = world.players["player_id"]
print(f"{player.name} ({player.age} years old)")
print(f"Current Rating: {player.overall_rating}")
print(f"Potential: {player.potential}")
print(f"Growth Room: +{player.potential - player.overall_rating}")

# Young prospects have most growth potential
young_players = [p for p in world.players.values() if p.age < 23]
top_prospects = sorted(young_players, 
                      key=lambda p: p.potential - p.overall_rating, 
                      reverse=True)
```

### Injury History

```python
from src.neuralnet.entities import InjuryRecord, InjuryType

# Add injury to player
injury = InjuryRecord(
    injury_type=InjuryType.HAMSTRING,
    occurred_date="2025-01-15",
    weeks_out=4,
    season=2025,
    match_id="match_123"
)
player.injury_history.append(injury)

# Review player's injury history
print(f"{player.name} - Career Injuries: {len(player.injury_history)}")
for injury in player.injury_history:
    print(f"  {injury.injury_type.value}: {injury.weeks_out} weeks")
```

### Player Awards

```python
from src.neuralnet.entities import PlayerAward

# Award player
award = PlayerAward(
    award_type="Golden Boot",
    season=2025,
    league="premier_fantasy",
    details="30 goals scored"
)
player.awards.append(award)

# Display awards
for award in player.awards:
    print(f"{award.award_type} ({award.season})")
```

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Best defense
curl http://localhost:8000/api/leagues/premier_fantasy/best-defense

# Response:
{
  "league_id": "premier_fantasy",
  "league_name": "Premier Fantasy League",
  "season": 2025,
  "best_defenses": [
    {
      "team_id": "man_blue",
      "team_name": "Man Blue",
      "goals_conceded": 12,
      "matches_played": 15,
      "average_per_game": 0.8,
      "clean_sheets": 8
    },
    ...
  ]
}

# Worst defense
