# Implementation Archives

This directory contains historical implementation summaries documenting the evolution of the Back of the Neural Net project.

## Files

### Main Implementation Summary
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Initial comprehensive feature implementation summary

### TODO Basket Rounds
These documents chronicle incremental feature additions from the TODO list, each focusing on different aspects of the game:

- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_TODO_BASKET.md** - Round 1: Penalty kicks, fouls, player attributes, team streaks
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_TODO_BASKET_ROUND3.md** - Round 3: Offsides, match commentary, advanced stats
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_TODO_BASKET_ROUND4.md** - Round 4: Weak foot rating, player match ratings, free kicks
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_TODO_BASKET_ROUND5.md** - Round 5: Skill moves, career statistics, league history
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_TODO_BASKET_ROUND6.md** - Round 6: Weather conditions, crowd attendance, player development
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_TODO_BASKET_ROUND7.md** - Round 7: Pitch conditions, team captains, average ratings

## Purpose

These documents are preserved for historical reference and to understand:
- The incremental development approach taken
- Which features were implemented and when
- The testing strategy for each feature set
- Technical decisions and trade-offs made

## Current Features

For the current state of implemented features, see the main [README.md](../../README.md) and [TODO.md](../../TODO.md).
