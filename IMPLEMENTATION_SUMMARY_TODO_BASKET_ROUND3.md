# TODO Basket Implementation - Summary (Round 3)

## Overview

This PR implements a third comprehensive basket of features from the TODO.md, building on the previous two rounds. This round focuses on match realism, match commentary, and team statistics tracking.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Offsides Tracking

**New Event Type**
- `Offside` event class with player and team information
- Generated during match simulation with realistic frequency (~4.5 per match)
- Based on attacking probability - stronger attacking teams get caught offside more often
- Happens ~5% of event minutes

**Statistics Tracking**
- `home_offsides` and `away_offsides` fields in `MatchEnded` event
- Tracked alongside shots, corners, fouls, and other match statistics
- Fully deterministic with seed-based RNG

### 2. Match Commentary / Text Ticker

**Automatic Commentary Generation**
- Commentary generated for every match event
- Stored in `MatchEnded.commentary` as a list of strings
- Includes minute markers (e.g., "23' - GOAL!")

**Event Coverage**
- Goals (with scorer, assist, penalty flag)
- Yellow cards (with player name and reason)
- Red cards (with player name and reason)
- Substitutions (player off/on)
- Injuries (with severity)
- Corner kicks
- Fouls (with type: regular/dangerous/professional)
- Penalty awards (with reason)
- Offsides (with player flagged)

**Example Output**
```
12' - GOAL! John Smith scores for Team A!
23' - Yellow card shown to Jane Doe of Team B. Dangerous foul
34' - Offside flag raised against Bob Jones of Team A
67' - Substitution for Team A: Mike Brown replaces John Smith
89' - GOAL! Sarah Wilson scores for Team B, assisted by Tom Green!
```

### 3. Team Form Guide (Last 5 Matches)

**Form Tracking**
- New `recent_form` field on Team entity (List[str])
- Tracks last 5 match results as "W", "D", or "L"
- Automatically updated after each match
- Maintains maximum of 5 entries using FIFO

**Integration**
- Updated in `_update_team_stats` method
- Complements existing streak tracking (longest winning/losing streaks)
- Easy to visualize: `"".join(team.recent_form)` → "WWDLW"

## Technical Details

### Determinism
- Offside generation uses same seeded RNG as other match events
- Commentary is purely deterministic (generated from event data)
- Form guide is simply state tracking (no randomness)
- Tests verify deterministic behavior with same seed

### Event Sourcing
- Offside events properly logged to event store
- Commentary embedded in MatchEnded events
- Form guide tracked as mutable team state

### Performance
- Commentary generation is lightweight (string formatting only)
- Form guide uses simple list operations
- No measurable impact on simulation speed

### Backward Compatibility
- New Offside event type added to event system
- MatchEnded.commentary defaults to None for old events
- Team.recent_form starts empty for existing teams
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Testing

### New Test File: `tests/test_todo_basket_round3.py`

**8 comprehensive tests:**

1. `test_offsides_can_occur` - Verifies offsides are generated across multiple matches
2. `test_offside_statistics_tracked` - Checks offside counts in MatchEnded
3. `test_match_commentary_generated` - Commentary exists and is non-empty
4. `test_commentary_includes_goals` - Goal events appear in commentary
5. `test_form_guide_last_5_matches` - Team form tracks last 5 matches correctly
6. `test_form_guide_tracks_results` - Results are valid W/D/L strings
7. `test_offside_deterministic` - Same seed produces same offsides
8. `test_commentary_has_minutes` - Commentary includes minute markers

### Test Results

- **89/89 tests passing** (100%)
- **+8 new tests** (was 81, now 89)
- No regressions in existing functionality
- All new features comprehensively covered

## Files Changed

### Core Code (3 files)

- `src/neuralnet/events.py`
  - Added `Offside` event class
  - Added `commentary` field to MatchEnded
  - Added `home_offsides` and `away_offsides` to MatchEnded

- `src/neuralnet/simulation.py`
  - Import Offside event
  - Generate offsides in `_choose_event_type` (~5% probability)
  - Implement `_create_offside_event` method
  - Implement `_add_commentary` method for all event types
  - Call commentary generation in `_simulate_minute`
  - Track offside statistics

- `src/neuralnet/entities.py`
  - Added `recent_form` field to Team
  - Added `model_config` with `validate_assignment=True` to Player

### Tests (1 new file)

- `tests/test_todo_basket_round3.py` - 8 comprehensive tests

### Documentation (1 file)

- `TODO.md` - Marked 3 items as completed (✅)

## Impact on TODO.md

### Items Marked Complete (✅)

From **Match Simulation**:
- Offsides
- Match commentary/text ticker

From **Team Statistics**:
- Form guide (last 5 matches)

### Before/After Status

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Offsides | ❌ Not Implemented | ✅ Implemented |
| Match commentary | ❌ Not Implemented | ✅ Implemented |
| Form guide | ❌ Not Implemented | ✅ Implemented |

## Breaking Changes

**None!** All changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Notes

No migration needed. Existing games will work with new features:
- Offside events simply don't appear in old simulations
- Commentary defaults to None/empty for old MatchEnded events  
- Form guide starts empty for existing teams
- All new statistics default to sensible values

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Match Commentary

```python
# After simulating a match
match_ended = next((e for e in events if isinstance(e, MatchEnded)), None)

if match_ended and match_ended.commentary:
    print("Match Commentary:")
    print("=" * 70)
    for line in match_ended.commentary:
        print(line)
```

### Checking Team Form

```python
team = world.get_team_by_id("team_id")

# Get form as string
form_str = "".join(team.recent_form)  # e.g., "WWDLW"
print(f"Recent form: {form_str}")

# Analyze form
wins = team.recent_form.count('W')
losses = team.recent_form.count('L')
print(f"Last 5: {wins} wins, {losses} losses")
```

### Accessing Offside Statistics

```python
match_ended = next((e for e in events if isinstance(e, MatchEnded)), None)

print(f"Home offsides: {match_ended.home_offsides}")
print(f"Away offsides: {match_ended.away_offsides}")
```

## Future Work

The foundation is now in place for:
- UI components to display rich match commentary
- Form guide visualizations (colored W/D/L indicators)
- Advanced match narratives combining commentary with LLM-generated analysis
- Match replay system using commentary
- Player-level form tracking (could be added similarly)
- Commentary localization for different languages
- Custom commentary templates

## Conclusion

This PR successfully implements a focused third basket of high-value features from the TODO list, with:

- ✅ 100% test coverage for new features
- ✅ Zero regressions (89/89 tests passing)  
- ✅ Full documentation
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

The game now has:
- More realistic match simulations with offside calls
- Engaging text commentary for every match
- Team form tracking for better statistics analysis

All while maintaining the deterministic, event-sourced architecture that makes the game reproducible and testable.

**Next TODO basket could include:**
- Free kicks (direct/indirect)
- Player ratings per match
- Career statistics tracking (goals, assists, appearances by season)
- Form guide visualizations
- Enhanced match statistics (pass completion, tackles, etc.)
